I'm a physical oceanographer with a special interest in physical/biogeochemical interactions. 
My research focus lies on understanding the small scale regional variability in the ocean
and in particular the vertical fluxes associated with it and their impact on the marine
ecosystem. My key expertise is the treatment and analysis of complex and
heterogeneous data sets to which I apply fluid dynamics theories to conduct and advance
my research.

I am currently employed as a research faculty in the Department of Estuarine and Ocean Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Before that I was an associate scientist at IMARPE (Lima, Peru), where I worked to strengthen the "glider" team and put in place best practices for glider operations and data processing.
